# SimonGame
Simon game remake made with AppBrewery class. This was a fun activity using jQuery utilizing event listeners and setTimeout for effects.
To play the game follow the pattern by clicking the button that animates and plays a sound. As you level up click the buttons in the same order that they originally animated.
